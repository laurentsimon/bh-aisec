# BlackHat USA 2025 Security Training

This is the Supply-Chain section for the [Theory and Practice: Machine Learning Security Threats and Vulnerabilities (Zero to Hero)](https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/training/schedule/#theory-and-practice-machine-learning-security-threats-and-vulnerabilities-zero-to-hero-44500) hosted in Las Vegas 2-5 Aug 2025.

## Skills required

Virtually none. If you have not coded in a while, you can still follow the workshop. All hands-on activities have code that is ready to be run. 
All you'll need to do is clone repositories, update configurations and click GitHub buttons or run commands in a terminal to follow along.

## Supporting materials

TODO
What's next: source track, dependency track
project1 -> inferrence

add goal of project in slides and activity 4?

activity 2: needs update
In this activity, we will focus on the integrity protections applied to an artifact during its development, i.e. its minimum SLSA level. This will help us achieve the first goal of the workshop, which is to ensure that all produced containers are protected against tampering across the SDLC.

ask users to red the python code. Add comment and in tutorial that we will update later to output a prediction
