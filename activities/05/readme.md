# 05 - Model integrity protection

We have prepared two activities you can chose from:

## SLSA for models

In [this activity](https://github.com/slsa-framework/oss-na24-slsa-workshop/blob/main/activities/01/slsa_for_models.md), you will train a model, generate provenance for the model and then verify it. Like [activity 01](https://github.com/slsa-framework/oss-na24-slsa-workshop/blob/main/activities/01/readme.md), this activity will use a provenance generator from [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) project.


## Signature for models

In [this activity](https://github.com/slsa-framework/oss-na24-slsa-workshop/blob/main/activities/01/model_signing.md), you will train a model, sign it and verify its signature.
