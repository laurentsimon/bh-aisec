# 01 - Generate and verify SLSA provenance

## Highlight

Let's start by familiarizing ourselves with the goal of this activity.

### What you will need

To complete this activity, you need:

1. A GitHub account
1. A docker registry account (alternatively you can use GitHub registry)

### Provenance generation

SLSA provenance is generated by a builder. In this activity, we will use [SLSA GitHub generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) project. As described in the project's [README](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-provenance), the project offers builders for [various ecosystems](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#builders). The project also support so-called "[generators](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#generators)" which only generate provenance without changing your build definition. In a nutshell, you will build your container as you always do and simply call the generator at the end your workflow to generate the provenance. In this activity, we will use the [container generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/container/README.md).

### Provenance verification

To verify the provenance, we will use the [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) project. Verifying provenance requires a builder and a source repository.

## Deep dive

### Provenance generation

#### Reading
Read the section [Getting started](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/container/README.md#getting-started) of the container generator. 

#### Create the workflow

Fork this repository [https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1) by clicking this [link](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/fork).

The repository contains a GitHub workflow [.github/workflow/build-echo-server.yml](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml) which builds and generates provenance for a hypothetical server. The file contains the following steps:

1. Authenticate to docker registry, see [here](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml#L33-L41).
1. Build the container and push it to docker registry as "echo-server", see [here](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml#L49-L56). The container code is stored in this repository under [images/echo-server/](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/images/echo-server) and it a simple echo server.
1. Extract the cryptographic digest of the container (see [here](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml#L58-L62)). Note that it is IMPORTANT that the digest be computed without interacting with the registry, to remove the registry from the trusted computing base.
1. In a diffeernt job, we call the container generator, see [here](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml#L64-L79).
1. As a verification step, we pull the container and verify it, see [here](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml#L81-L102).

#### Run the workflow

Follow these steps:

1. You need to update the [REGISTRY_USERNAME](https://github.com/laurentsimon/oss-na24-slsa-workshop-project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-echo-server.yml#L15) to your own docker registry username.
1. Store your docker regitry token (with push access) by going to your repository [Settings > New repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).
2. Run the workflow via the [GitHub UI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow).


#### Verify provenance

To install slsa-verifier, follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier?tab=readme-ov-file#option-1-install-via-go).

To verify your container, use the following command:

```shell
TODO
```

The slsa-verifier verifies:

1. The cryptographic digest of the container matches the one in the attestation
2. The repository that the container was built was your repoistory.

Pass command `--show-provenance` to see the plaintext intoto attestation.

Explore other commands by using the `--help` command. You cna read more on the project repository.
